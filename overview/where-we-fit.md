# Where we fit

Hubzz sits between mainstream social platforms and fully immersive virtual worlds. We combine the discovery, brevity, and low-friction access of social media with the persistence, presence, and community ownership of virtual spaces.

Key points:

- Low barrier: instant browser access with no downloads or complicated setup.
- Selective immersion: join 2D feeds or drop into immersive 3D spaces when you want deeper presence.
- Community-first: spaces are owned and customized by communities and creators, not just platform tenants.

This positioning helps creators, communities, and casual users find a middle ground — accessible, social, and extensible — rather than forcing a choice between short-form social apps or complex metaverse platforms.
