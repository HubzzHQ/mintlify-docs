# Welcome to Hubzz

Hubzz is the first **Hyper-Casual Metaverseâ„¢** - a mainstream-friendly social virtual world that combines the accessibility of social media with the immersion of virtual worlds (and the benefits of Web3).

Think of it as **TikTok meets Discord in 3D** - where you can discover communities through an algorithmic feed, then instantly join immersive 3D spaces with just one click.
